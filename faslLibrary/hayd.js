          "Habit 6 days. Bleeds exactly 6.",
          `When bleeding aligns precisely with her established habit and remains within the valid menstrual limits recognized in the Maliki school, the classification is clear. This is ḥayḍ without dispute. The ruling remains in force until clear purity appears, either through dryness or the well-known white discharge. At that point, ghusl becomes obligatory and all suspended acts of worship resume.`
        ],

        [
          "Habit 7 days. Bleeds only 5.",
          `A shorter episode does not invalidate menstruation. In the Maliki school, what matters is that the bleeding fulfills the legal criteria of menstrual blood. Variations in length occur naturally. Therefore, the five days are valid ḥayḍ. Upon confirmed cessation, ghusl is performed and worship resumes immediately.`

        [
          "Bleeding begins three days earlier than usual.",
          `Menstrual cycles are not bound to exact calendar dates. If the blood fulfills the recognized characteristics and falls within valid time limits, it is ḥayḍ even if it begins earlier than expected. Habit guides excess cases, not normal variation.`

        [
          "Flow is very light for entire duration.",
          `Intensity of flow is not decisive in Maliki fiqh. Even minimal bleeding can constitute ḥayḍ so long as it fulfills the required legal minimum and falls within menstrual limits. Lightness does not negate validity.`

        [
          "Severe cramps but minimal visible blood.",
          `Pain is not the determinant in fiqh classification. Legal rulings attach to the presence of blood, not physical discomfort. If blood is present within menstrual parameters, it is ḥayḍ. If no blood appears, cramps alone do not suspend worship.`

        [
          "Color changes from red to dark brown during same episode.",
          `Variation in color does not divide a menstrual episode so long as continuity remains and limits are not exceeded. In Maliki doctrine, connected blood of varying shades within time limits is one unified ḥayḍ.`
