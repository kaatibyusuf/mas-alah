          `If her established habit is six days, and in a given month she bleeds exactly six days, then the matter is straightforward.

Those six days are ḥayḍ.

When the bleeding stops and she sees a clear sign of ṭuhr, either confirmed dryness or the white discharge, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. There is no need for extended calculation because the bleeding did not exceed her habit and did not approach the maximum of fifteen days.

If bleeding stops on the sixth day and purity is seen, the cycle has ended normally. If slight discharge continues but no real ṭuhr has appeared, then she waits until purity is established.

When habit and reality match exactly, there is no complexity. The law follows what is clear and stable.

          `If her established habit is seven days, but in a particular month the bleeding stops at five days, then we do not force the cycle to remain seven simply because that was the past pattern.

The ruling follows what is actually present.

If on the fifth day she sees clear ṭuhr. That means confirmed dryness or the white discharge. Then her ḥayḍ has ended at five days. She performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. She does not wait two extra days just to match her former habit.

Habit guides when bleeding is unclear or exceeds limits. It does not extend menstruation when purity has clearly appeared.

However, if bleeding appears to pause on day five but she does not see true ṭuhr. Only lightening, spotting, or unstable fluctuation. Then she waits until purity is firmly established or until the maximum of fifteen days is reached.

So the principle is simple. When purity is certain, ḥayḍ ends, even if earlier than usual. The Sharīʿah follows reality, not expectation.`

The first thing we check is whether the minimum interval of ṭuhr has passed. If fifteen full days of valid purity have passed since the end of her last ḥayḍ, then this new bleeding can legally be ḥayḍ, even if it arrived earlier than her normal schedule.

Habit helps with expectation, but it does not lock the calendar. The body can shift. If the bleeding has the characteristics of menstruation and occurs within a time where ḥayḍ is legally possible, it is treated as ḥayḍ.

However, if fifteen days of ṭuhr have not yet passed, then it cannot be classified as a new ḥayḍ, even if it looks identical to her usual menses. In that case it is treated as istiḥāḍah. The key is not whether it is early. The key is whether the conditions for ḥayḍ are legally met. If they are, the earlier timing does not invalidate it.

Menstruation is not defined by how much blood exits, but by its occurrence within valid time, its continuity, and its staying within the legal limits.

If the flow is light from beginning to end, yet it continues within a period where ḥayḍ is possible, and it does not exceed fifteen days, then it is still treated as ḥayḍ. Light bleeding does not downgrade it to istiḥāḍah simply because it is not heavy.

What matters is that it is uterine bleeding occurring within valid parameters, not the volume.

Only when the bleeding crosses the maximum of fifteen days, or appears before fifteen days of ṭuhr have passed, or is clearly irregular outside the framework of menstruation, does the ruling change.

So, light flow alone does not alter classification. The law follows structure and limits, not intensity.`

In the Mālikī madhhab, ḥayḍ is established by the presence of blood, not by cramps alone. Pain may accompany menstruation, but it is not the legal cause. The cause is خروج الدم. The exiting of blood.

If there is visible blood, even if minimal, and it occurs within a time where ḥayḍ is possible and within the legal limits, then it is treated as ḥayḍ, regardless of how light it appears.

If there are severe cramps but no visible blood at all, then she is not considered menstruating. Pain without discharge does not suspend prayer or fasting.

If blood is extremely minimal, such as slight spotting with cramps, we then examine timing. If fifteen days of ṭuhr have passed and it is connected to what appears to be the start of her cycle, it may be treated as ḥayḍ even if light. If it is outside those conditions, it may be istiḥāḍah.

Cramps inform the biological picture, but they do not establish the legal ruling. The ruling follows confirmed bleeding within valid limits.`

In the Mālikī madhhab, if bleeding begins red and then shifts to dark brown, yellowish, or lighter shades, and this occurs without a confirmed ṭuhr in between, all of it is treated as one ḥayḍ. Variation in color is normal. Menstrual blood does not remain one shade.

What matters is continuity and the absence of a true sign of purity. As long as there has been no complete dryness and no white discharge marking ṭuhr, the episode remains legally unified.

The Companion Umm ʿAṭiyyah mentioned that yellow and brown discharge after purity was not treated as ḥayḍ. The key is after purity. Before purity, it counts.

So a shift from red to dark brown within the same connected flow does not reclassify the bleeding. It remains ḥayḍ as long as it stays within the legal maximum of fifteen days.`

Menstruation does not have to begin bright red. It may begin brown, then deepen. As long as it develops into clear menstrual bleeding and remains continuous within the valid limits, the entire connected period is ḥayḍ.

However, if the brown discharge appears briefly and stops, and no red flow follows, then it is not automatically treated as ḥayḍ. It may simply be irregular discharge. The key is connection.

The Companion Umm ʿAṭiyyah رضي الله عنها said that they did not consider yellow or brown discharge after purity to be anything. The phrase after purity is decisive.

So once ṭuhr is established, any yellow discharge that appears afterward does not suspend prayer or fasting. She remains ṭāhir. She does not repeat ghusl for that discharge.

The only time it would be reconsidered is if it develops into a new, connected bleeding episode after a valid interval of ṭuhr has passed.

Otherwise, yellow discharge after confirmed purity carries no ruling of menstruation. She continues her worship without hesitation.

The first consideration is the minimum interval of ṭuhr. If fifteen full days of valid purity have not passed since the previous ḥayḍ, that spotting cannot be treated as a new menstruation. It is considered istiḥāḍah.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine whether the spotting is continuous and develops into a connected menstrual flow. If it is brief, isolated, and stops without developing into a recognizable cycle, it is not treated as ḥayḍ. Menstruation is not established by a single disconnected stain.

If, however, the brown discharge continues and becomes connected to clear menstrual bleeding within valid limits, it may be counted from its onset as ḥayḍ.

The decisive factors are legal possibility and continuity. A single isolated brown spot mid-cycle, without connection to an ongoing flow, does not suspend prayer or fasting. She remains ṭāhir.`

What matters is the presence of blood exiting, not whether it flows onto clothing or a pad. If she wipes and sees clear blood within a time where ḥayḍ is legally possible, and it continues in a connected manner, it can be treated as ḥayḍ even if the amount is small and only visible upon wiping.

If it is within her menstrual window and remains connected to a developing flow, it counts.

However, if it is a single stain that appears once when wiping and then does not continue, it is not automatically ḥayḍ. It may be irregular discharge. Continuity is required to establish menstruation.

If fifteen days of valid ṭuhr have not passed since the previous cycle, then it cannot be classified as a new ḥayḍ regardless of how it appears.

The ruling follows timing, continuity, and legal limits. The method of noticing it, whether by wiping or visible flow, does not independently determine classification.

          `If spotting appears the day after ghusl, the ruling depends on what preceded that ghusl and whether true ṭuhr had been established.

If she performed ghusl after confirmed purity. Meaning she had seen complete dryness or the white discharge. Then spotting that appears afterward is not automatically ḥayḍ. In the Mālikī madhhab, yellow or brown discharge after established ṭuhr is not treated as menstruation. She remains ṭāhir unless that spotting develops into a new, connected menstrual flow and the minimum interval of fifteen days of ṭuhr has passed.

However, if the ghusl was performed prematurely. Meaning she thought she was pure but had not actually seen a reliable sign of ṭuhr, and the spotting appears as part of a continuous pattern within fifteen days of the original bleeding, then it is treated as continuation of the same ḥayḍ. In that case, the earlier ghusl was simply done too early.

So the decisive questions are these. Was purity clearly established before the ghusl? And has the minimum interval of ṭuhr passed? If purity was real, the spotting does not undo it. If purity was not firmly established, the episode may still be ongoing ḥayḍ.`

          `In the Mālikī madhhab, we look at continuity and stability.

If she bleeds for three days, then sees dryness for one day, then bleeding resumes for two more days, we examine the nature of that dryness.

If the dryness was brief and occurred within what appears to be one connected menstrual episode, especially if it happened within her normal window and the total does not exceed fifteen days, the Mālikīs generally treat this as one continuous ḥayḍ. The one day of dryness is absorbed into the cycle. She is not required to treat that day as ṭuhr unless the dryness was clearly established and stable in a way that normally marks the end of her cycle.

If, however, on that dry day she saw clear, confirmed ṭuhr, meaning reliable dryness or the white discharge consistent with how her menses usually ends, then that day is considered purity. She would perform ghusl and pray. If bleeding returns afterward, it is assessed separately. If fifteen days of ṭuhr have not passed since the previous cycle, the returning blood would be istiḥāḍah, not a new ḥayḍ.

In most cases where dryness occurs briefly in the middle of an ongoing pattern and bleeding resumes shortly after, the Mālikī position treats it as one unified ḥayḍ as long as it remains within the fifteen-day maximum.

The decisive factor is whether that day of dryness truly resembled the end of her cycle or was merely a short interruption within it.`

A short pause of several hours, especially overnight, does not automatically establish ṭuhr. Menstrual flow can fluctuate within the same cycle. Unless she saw a clear and stable sign of purity, meaning confirmed dryness in a way that resembles the actual end of her period, or the white discharge, the interruption is absorbed into the same episode.

If the bleeding resumes the next morning and the total duration remains within fifteen days, it is treated as one unified ḥayḍ.

However, if during the night she checked and saw clear, reliable ṭuhr consistent with how her cycle normally ends, and that purity was established, then ghusl would have been required. If blood returns afterward, we would assess it separately depending on timing and the minimum interval of ṭuhr.

The decisive question is not the length of the pause alone, but whether the dryness was clear and stable in a way that normally marks the end of her cycle. If she saw confirmed dryness or the white discharge consistent with how her menses usually ends, and it appeared settled rather than temporary, that would count as ṭuhr. Ghusl would then be required. If blood returns afterward, it would be assessed separately.

But if the dryness lasted half a day and bleeding resumed in a manner that appears connected to the earlier flow, the Mālikī position generally treats the entire episode as one continuous ḥayḍ.

If bleeding then resumes within the same overall menstrual window and the total remains under fifteen days, the Mālikīs often treat it as a continuation of the same ḥayḍ, with the intervening days considered legally connected to it. The law looks at the entire episode as one unit when it remains within the maximum limit.

If, however, the two days were uncertain. Meaning intermittent checking with fluctuation or no clear sign of established purity. Then the interruption is treated as part of the ongoing ḥayḍ, and the resumed bleeding is simply continuation.

The governing principles are continuity, confirmed ṭuhr, and the fifteen-day maximum. As long as the total episode does not exceed fifteen days, resumed bleeding within that span is generally absorbed into the same ḥayḍ unless a clearly established and settled purity reset the ruling..`

Intensity is not the measure. Continuity and legal limits are.

If the light flow is still actual bleeding, even minimal spotting that remains connected to the episode, it counts. A fluctuation in volume does not break the cycle.

If she saw reliable dryness or the white discharge in a settled way that normally marks the conclusion of her menses, that would establish ṭuhr and require ghusl.
