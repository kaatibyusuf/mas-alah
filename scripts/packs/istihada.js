          "Spotting daily for an entire month.",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, spotting daily for an entire month cannot all be treated as ḥayḍ.

The maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days. No matter how similar the blood looks from beginning to end, it cannot legally exceed that limit.

So if spotting continues for thirty days, the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ, provided menstruation was legally possible at the start. From day sixteen onward, it is classified as istiḥāḍah.

She performs ghusl at the completion of day fifteen and resumes prayer and fasting. The continued daily spotting is managed as istiḥāḍah. She cleans herself, uses protection, performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and prays even if spotting continues.

If she has a known stable habit shorter than fifteen days, that habit becomes relevant in organizing future cycles if this prolonged pattern repeats. But the immediate rule remains firm. Ḥayḍ cannot exceed fifteen days, even if spotting continues every day of the month. In the Maliki school, excess blood does not suspend prayer or fasting. The woman maintains worship with proper purification.`

        [
          "Light red discharge daily outside menstrual timing.",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, light red discharge that appears daily outside the time in which menstruation is legally possible is not treated as ḥayḍ.

The first thing we examine is the minimum interval of ṭuhr. If fifteen full days of valid purity have not passed since the previous ḥayḍ, then this light red discharge cannot be classified as a new menstruation, even if it resembles menstrual blood.

If fifteen days have passed but the discharge appears in a pattern clearly outside her normal cycle and does not develop into a connected episode within the legal limits, it is treated as istiḥāḍah.

Daily light red discharge that does not fit within the framework of a menstrual episode and continues beyond fifteen days cannot remain ḥayḍ. The legal structure overrides the appearance.

In such a case, she is considered ṭāhir in ruling. She prays and fasts, manages the discharge by cleaning herself and performing wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and does not suspend worship on account of it.`
        ],

        [
          "Brown mid-cycle spotting.",
          `This is not automatically ḥayḍ.

The first question is whether fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr have passed since the previous ḥayḍ. If they have not, this spotting cannot legally be a new menstruation. It is treated as istiḥāḍah, even if the color resembles the beginning or end of a normal cycle.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine continuity. If the brown spotting is brief, isolated, and does not develop into a connected menstrual flow, it is not treated as ḥayḍ. Menstruation is not established by a single disconnected stain.

If, however, the brown discharge continues and becomes connected to a developing episode within the legal limits, it may be counted as ḥayḍ from its onset.

Timing and continuity determine the ruling. Color alone does not.`

        [
          "Daily staining only when wiping.",
          `Daily staining that is only seen when wiping is not judged by how it is noticed, but by timing and continuity.

If fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr have not passed since the last ḥayḍ, then this staining cannot be a new menstruation. It is treated as istiḥāḍah, even if it appears every day.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine whether this staining forms a connected menstrual episode. If it remains light, does not develop into a recognizable flow, and continues in a scattered or minimal way, it is not treated as ḥayḍ. Menstruation requires a coherent episode within the legal limits, not merely faint daily traces.

If it develops into a connected flow within fifteen days and fits the framework of ḥayḍ, it may be classified accordingly.

The ruling follows legal structure. Minimal staining noticed only upon wiping, without a connected menstrual pattern, is treated as istiḥāḍah, and she remains obligated to pray and fast.`

        [
          "Stress-related irregular bleeding.",
          `Stress can absolutely disturb the body’s rhythm. Hormonal shifts can cause early bleeding, delayed cycles, prolonged spotting, or lighter flow. But in fiqh, we do not classify bleeding based on its emotional cause. We classify it based on timing, continuity, and legal limits.

If stress causes bleeding to appear after fifteen days of valid ṭuhr, and it continues in a connected manner within fifteen days, it is treated as ḥayḍ even if the trigger was stress.

If stress causes prolonged bleeding that exceeds fifteen days, then the first fifteen are ḥayḍ and the rest is istiḥāḍah, regardless of the cause.

If stress causes scattered spotting outside the menstrual framework and it does not form a coherent episode, it is treated as istiḥāḍah.

Sharʿī rulings are not built on the reason behind the bleeding, but on its structure. The body may fluctuate. The law remains steady.

If stress-related irregularity becomes frequent, it is wise to consult a physician. Fiqh addresses classification. Medicine addresses underlying imbalance.`

        [
          "Ovulation bleeding.",
          `Ovulation bleeding is usually light spotting that occurs mid-cycle, often around the time of ovulation.

In fiqh, it is not classified based on its biological label but on legal structure.

If this spotting occurs before fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr have passed since the last ḥayḍ, it cannot be treated as a new menstruation. It is istiḥāḍah.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine whether it forms a connected menstrual episode. Ovulation bleeding is typically brief and does not develop into a sustained flow within the legal limits. In such cases, it is treated as istiḥāḍah, not ḥayḍ.

Menstruation requires a coherent episode that fits within the recognized framework of timing and continuity. Brief mid-cycle spotting that does not develop into a cycle does not suspend prayer or fasting.

She remains ṭāhir in ruling. She prays and fasts, managing the spotting as istiḥāḍah.`

          "Spotting continues after maximum menstrual days.",
          `When spotting continues after the maximum menstrual limit has been reached, the ruling is no longer tied to appearance.

The maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days. Once day fifteen is completed, menstruation has legally ended, even if discharge continues.

If spotting appears on day sixteen and beyond, it is classified as istiḥāḍah, regardless of color or amount. At the end of day fifteen, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. The continued spotting does not suspend worship.

From that point forward, she manages it as istiḥāḍah. She cleans herself, uses protection if needed, performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and prays even if spotting persists.

Legal limits govern the ruling. Once the ceiling is crossed, the state changes.`

Anything beyond that point, whether continuous bleeding or repeated stopping and resuming, is treated as istiḥāḍah.

Even if the pattern becomes stop–start–stop–start after the fifteenth day, it does not return to being ḥayḍ. The legal ceiling has already been crossed. At the end of day fifteen, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. From that point forward, any discharge is managed as istiḥāḍah.

She cleans herself, uses protection if needed, and performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time. The fluctuation of bleeding does not change the classification once the maximum has been passed.

The limit governs. Reappearance does not revive ḥayḍ after the ceiling has been reached.`

          `Irregular light bleeding that lasts for weeks is not automatically treated as ḥayḍ.

The maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days. No matter how light or how similar the blood appears, it cannot remain menstruation beyond that limit.

If the bleeding began at a time when ḥayḍ was legally possible, then the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ. From day sixteen onward, it is istiḥāḍah, even if it continues in the same light pattern.

If the light bleeding began before fifteen days of valid ṭuhr had passed since the last cycle, then it is istiḥāḍah from the start.

When bleeding lasts for weeks, structure is imposed. She performs ghusl at the end of the fifteenth day if menstruation was valid at the beginning. After that, she prays and fasts, managing the discharge as istiḥāḍah by cleaning herself and performing wuḍū’ for each prayer time.

Length alone does not make it ḥayḍ. Legal limits define it.`

          "Clear discharge mixed with faint blood daily.",
          `This is judged by timing and limits, not by dilution.

If this mixture appears after fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr, and it forms a connected episode within fifteen days, it can be treated as ḥayḍ, even if the blood is faint and mixed with clear fluid.

If it appears before fifteen days of ṭuhr have passed, it cannot be a new ḥayḍ. It is istiḥāḍah.

If it continues beyond fifteen days, then only the first fifteen may be counted as ḥayḍ if menstruation was valid at the start. Anything beyond that is istiḥāḍah.

If the discharge is light, scattered, and does not form a coherent menstrual episode, it is treated as istiḥāḍah from the outset.

The mixture of clear discharge with faint blood does not alter the structure. The ruling follows timing, continuity, and the maximum limit.`

          "Habit 6 days, bleeding continues 14.",
          `If her established habit is six days but the bleeding continues until day fourteen, the ruling follows the legal limit, not the old pattern.

As long as the bleeding remains continuous and the total does not exceed fifteen days, all fourteen days are treated as ḥayḍ.

Habit becomes decisive when the maximum is crossed or when there is confusion. It does not automatically cut the cycle short while bleeding continues within the permissible ceiling.

So in this case, the entire fourteen days are ḥayḍ. She does not pray or fast during those days. When confirmed ṭuhr appears, she performs ghusl and resumes worship.`

          `If her old habit is unclear, but for the last three months she has seen the same consistent pattern, that new pattern is treated as her ʿādah.

In fiqh, habit is established by stability. When a pattern repeats in a consistent way over consecutive cycles, it becomes the reference point moving forward. The Sharīʿah looks at what is currently stable, not what was distant or forgotten.

So if for three months she has bled, for example, eight days each time in a similar structure, that eight-day pattern now functions as her habit. If irregularity occurs afterward, she refers back to this established pattern.

However, all of this operates within the legal limits. No ḥayḍ can exceed fifteen days. No new cycle can begin without fifteen days of valid ṭuhr in between.

Consistency creates certainty. Once a pattern stabilizes, it becomes the anchor for future rulings unless it clearly changes again.

          "Habit 5 days, bleeds only 2 this month.",
          `If her established habit is five days, but this month she bleeds only two days, the ruling follows what actually occurred, not the old expectation.

If on the second day she sees confirmed ṭuhr. Meaning complete dryness or the white discharge. Then her ḥayḍ has ended at two days. She performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. She does not wait until day five simply because that was her previous habit.

Habit guides when bleeding continues or becomes confusing. It does not prolong menstruation when purity has clearly appeared.

If bleeding stops at two days and does not return, the cycle for that month is two days. If bleeding resumes later within fifteen days without confirmed ṭuhr in between, it may be treated as continuation.

The law follows reality, not memory of past patterns.`

        [
          "Habit shifts gradually over months.",
          `When a habit shifts gradually over several months, the law recognizes the new stability once it becomes consistent.

Habit in fiqh is not frozen. It reflects what is established and recurring. If a woman used to bleed five days, then for several consecutive months she bleeds six, then seven, and that pattern stabilizes, the new consistent length becomes her ʿādah.

The key is repetition and stability, not a single fluctuation. One unusual month does not immediately redefine the habit. But a recurring pattern over multiple cycles establishes a new reference point.

All of this operates within the legal limits. No ḥayḍ can exceed fifteen days. No new cycle can begin without fifteen days of valid ṭuhr between them.

Gradual shifts are normal. Once the new pattern proves consistent, it becomes the anchor for future rulings.`

          "Single abnormal extended month.",
          `If one month is abnormally extended, but it is a single occurrence, it does not immediately redefine her established habit.

If the bleeding remained within fifteen days, then the entire extended period is treated as ḥayḍ for that month, even if it exceeded her usual number of days. Her prior habit is not erased by one fluctuation.

If the bleeding exceeded fifteen days, then only the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ. Anything beyond that is istiḥāḍah. After this month ends, her previous stable habit remains her reference for future cycles unless a new consistent pattern develops over time.

A single abnormal month is treated as an exception. Habit changes only with repeated stability, not with one irregular episode.`

          "PCOS causes long irregular bleeding.",
          `PCOS can cause prolonged, irregular, or unpredictable bleeding. That is a medical reality. But the legal ruling is not built on the diagnosis. It is built on structure and limits.

If bleeding begins at a time when ḥayḍ is legally possible, then the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ. Once day fifteen is completed, anything beyond that is istiḥāḍah, even if the bleeding continues in the same pattern for weeks.

If bleeding appears before fifteen days of valid ṭuhr have passed since the last cycle, it cannot be a new ḥayḍ. It is istiḥāḍah from the start.

When PCOS causes frequent irregular discharge, the woman does not suspend prayer for weeks or months. The Sharʿī ceiling protects her from that. She performs ghusl at the end of the valid ḥayḍ window and resumes prayer and fasting, managing the ongoing bleeding as istiḥāḍah with cleaning and wuḍū’ for each prayer time.

Medical causes explain why the bleeding happens. Legal limits determine how it is classified.`

          "Habit 7, now stable at 10 for months.",
          `If her old habit was seven days, but for several consecutive months she has been bleeding ten days in a stable and consistent pattern, then ten days becomes her new ʿādah.

Habit in fiqh follows stability. Once a new length repeats consistently over multiple cycles, it replaces the former one.

So if she now regularly bleeds ten days and then sees confirmed ṭuhr, those ten days are treated as ḥayḍ. If irregularity later occurs, she refers back to this new established pattern of ten.

All of this remains within the legal maximum of fifteen days. As long as the bleeding does not exceed that limit, the consistent ten-day pattern is fully valid.

Habit is anchored to what is presently stable, not what was distant in the past.`

          "Bleeding resumes briefly after habit days.",
          `If her established habit ends, for example, at seven days, and bleeding resumes briefly after those habit days, we do not immediately separate it from the cycle.

The first question is whether confirmed ṭuhr had appeared. If she saw clear dryness or the white discharge in a stable way that marks the end of her menses, then the habit cycle ended. If bleeding resumes afterward and fifteen days of valid ṭuhr have not passed, that resumed blood is treated as istiḥāḍah, not a new ḥayḍ.

If there was no confirmed ṭuhr. Meaning the flow lightened or paused but did not reach clear purity. Then the resumed bleeding is treated as continuation of the same ḥayḍ, provided the total duration does not exceed fifteen days.

So the decisive factor is whether true purity was established. If yes, the cycle ended. If not, the resumed bleeding remains part of the same menstrual episode within the legal maximum.`

When the bleeding stops long enough for her to wash, perform wuḍū’, and complete the prayer within its time, she should take advantage of that pause and pray during it. In this situation, she is not treated as someone with continuous discharge because there is a workable window of dryness.

When the pause is extremely short or unpredictable, such that she cannot realistically complete purification and prayer before bleeding resumes, she is treated as having continuous istiḥāḍah. She waits for the prayer time to enter, cleans herself, applies protection, performs wuḍū’, and prays. The prayer remains valid even if bleeding resumes during it.

The ruling follows realistic capacity. A usable pause should be used. An unusable pause does not create hardship.`

Once the prayer time enters, she cleans the area, applies protection, and performs wuḍūʾ. After that, any discharge that continues is excused for that specific prayer time. Even if it appears right after wuḍūʾ, she proceeds to pray, and the prayer is valid.

She does not repeat wuḍūʾ for the same prayer time unless another nullifier unrelated to istiḥāḍah occurs.

When the next prayer time enters, she repeats the process: cleaning if necessary, protection, then a fresh wuḍūʾ for that new time.

The key principle is that continuous or near-continuous discharge in istiḥāḍah is treated as a chronic excuse. It does not place her in endless repetition of wuḍūʾ within the same prayer window.`

If she has performed wuḍūʾ properly and then discharge appears due to istiḥāḍah, her state remains valid for that prayer time. Her recitation is valid. Her prayer is valid. She does not need to stop or repeat unless another nullifier occurs.

Even beyond istiḥāḍah, doubt alone does not cancel an act of worship. Certainty is not removed by fear.

Brief, scattered spotting that appears once or twice during the day and does not develop into a coherent flow is not treated as ḥayḍ. It does not suspend prayer or fasting.

A faint mark whose nature is unclear does not suspend prayer or invalidate wuḍūʾ. The Sharʿī principle is that certainty is not removed by doubt.

Only when it is clearly blood, and it occurs within the framework of menstruation, does the ruling shift. Mere suspicion or unclear staining does not create a new legal state.
