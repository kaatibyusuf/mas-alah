          "Spotting daily for an entire month.",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, spotting daily for an entire month cannot all be treated as ḥayḍ.

The maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days. No matter how similar the blood looks from beginning to end, it cannot legally exceed that limit.

So if spotting continues for thirty days, the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ, provided menstruation was legally possible at the start. From day sixteen onward, it is classified as istiḥāḍah.

She performs ghusl at the completion of day fifteen and resumes prayer and fasting. The continued daily spotting is managed as istiḥāḍah. She cleans herself, uses protection, performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and prays even if spotting continues.

If she has a known stable habit shorter than fifteen days, that habit becomes relevant in organizing future cycles if this prolonged pattern repeats. But the immediate rule remains firm. Ḥayḍ cannot exceed fifteen days, even if spotting continues every day of the month. In the Maliki school, excess blood does not suspend prayer or fasting. The woman maintains worship with proper purification.`
        ],

        [
          "Light red discharge daily outside menstrual timing.",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, light red discharge that appears daily outside the time in which menstruation is legally possible is not treated as ḥayḍ.

The first thing we examine is the minimum interval of ṭuhr. If fifteen full days of valid purity have not passed since the previous ḥayḍ, then this light red discharge cannot be classified as a new menstruation, even if it resembles menstrual blood.

If fifteen days have passed but the discharge appears in a pattern clearly outside her normal cycle and does not develop into a connected episode within the legal limits, it is treated as istiḥāḍah.

Daily light red discharge that does not fit within the framework of a menstrual episode and continues beyond fifteen days cannot remain ḥayḍ. The legal structure overrides the appearance.

In such a case, she is considered ṭāhir in ruling. She prays and fasts, manages the discharge by cleaning herself and performing wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and does not suspend worship on account of it.`
        ],

        [
          "Brown mid-cycle spotting.",
          `This is not automatically ḥayḍ.

The first question is whether fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr have passed since the previous ḥayḍ. If they have not, this spotting cannot legally be a new menstruation. It is treated as istiḥāḍah, even if the color resembles the beginning or end of a normal cycle.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine continuity. If the brown spotting is brief, isolated, and does not develop into a connected menstrual flow, it is not treated as ḥayḍ. Menstruation is not established by a single disconnected stain.

If, however, the brown discharge continues and becomes connected to a developing episode within the legal limits, it may be counted as ḥayḍ from its onset.

Timing and continuity determine the ruling. Color alone does not.`
        ],

        [
          "Daily staining only when wiping.",
          `Daily staining that is only seen when wiping is not judged by how it is noticed, but by timing and continuity.

If fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr have not passed since the last ḥayḍ, then this staining cannot be a new menstruation. It is treated as istiḥāḍah, even if it appears every day.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine whether this staining forms a connected menstrual episode. If it remains light, does not develop into a recognizable flow, and continues in a scattered or minimal way, it is not treated as ḥayḍ. Menstruation requires a coherent episode within the legal limits, not merely faint daily traces.

If it develops into a connected flow within fifteen days and fits the framework of ḥayḍ, it may be classified accordingly.

The ruling follows legal structure. Minimal staining noticed only upon wiping, without a connected menstrual pattern, is treated as istiḥāḍah, and she remains obligated to pray and fast.`
        ],

        [
          "Stress-related irregular bleeding.",
          `Stress can absolutely disturb the body’s rhythm. Hormonal shifts can cause early bleeding, delayed cycles, prolonged spotting, or lighter flow. But in fiqh, we do not classify bleeding based on its emotional cause. We classify it based on timing, continuity, and legal limits.

If stress causes bleeding to appear after fifteen days of valid ṭuhr, and it continues in a connected manner within fifteen days, it is treated as ḥayḍ even if the trigger was stress.

If stress causes prolonged bleeding that exceeds fifteen days, then the first fifteen are ḥayḍ and the rest is istiḥāḍah, regardless of the cause.

If stress causes scattered spotting outside the menstrual framework and it does not form a coherent episode, it is treated as istiḥāḍah.

Sharʿī rulings are not built on the reason behind the bleeding, but on its structure. The body may fluctuate. The law remains steady.

If stress-related irregularity becomes frequent, it is wise to consult a physician. Fiqh addresses classification. Medicine addresses underlying imbalance.`

        [
          "Ovulation bleeding.",
          `Ovulation bleeding is usually light spotting that occurs mid-cycle, often around the time of ovulation.

In fiqh, it is not classified based on its biological label but on legal structure.

If this spotting occurs before fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr have passed since the last ḥayḍ, it cannot be treated as a new menstruation. It is istiḥāḍah.

If fifteen days have passed, we then examine whether it forms a connected menstrual episode. Ovulation bleeding is typically brief and does not develop into a sustained flow within the legal limits. In such cases, it is treated as istiḥāḍah, not ḥayḍ.

Menstruation requires a coherent episode that fits within the recognized framework of timing and continuity. Brief mid-cycle spotting that does not develop into a cycle does not suspend prayer or fasting.

She remains ṭāhir in ruling. She prays and fasts, managing the spotting as istiḥāḍah.`

        [
          "Spotting continues after maximum menstrual days.",
          `When spotting continues after the maximum menstrual limit has been reached, the ruling is no longer tied to appearance.

The maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days. Once day fifteen is completed, menstruation has legally ended, even if discharge continues.

If spotting appears on day sixteen and beyond, it is classified as istiḥāḍah, regardless of color or amount. At the end of day fifteen, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. The continued spotting does not suspend worship.

From that point forward, she manages it as istiḥāḍah. She cleans herself, uses protection if needed, performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and prays even if spotting persists.

Legal limits govern the ruling. Once the ceiling is crossed, the state changes.`

        [
          "Bleeding stops and resumes repeatedly beyond limit.",
          `If the total bleeding has already reached fifteen days, then ḥayḍ has legally ended at the completion of day fifteen.

Anything beyond that point, whether continuous bleeding or repeated stopping and resuming, is treated as istiḥāḍah.

Even if the pattern becomes stop–start–stop–start after the fifteenth day, it does not return to being ḥayḍ. The legal ceiling has already been crossed. At the end of day fifteen, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. From that point forward, any discharge is managed as istiḥāḍah.

She cleans herself, uses protection if needed, and performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time. The fluctuation of bleeding does not change the classification once the maximum has been passed.

The limit governs. Reappearance does not revive ḥayḍ after the ceiling has been reached.`

          "Irregular light bleeding lasting weeks.",
          `Irregular light bleeding that lasts for weeks is not automatically treated as ḥayḍ.

The maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days. No matter how light or how similar the blood appears, it cannot remain menstruation beyond that limit.

If the bleeding began at a time when ḥayḍ was legally possible, then the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ. From day sixteen onward, it is istiḥāḍah, even if it continues in the same light pattern.

If the light bleeding began before fifteen days of valid ṭuhr had passed since the last cycle, then it is istiḥāḍah from the start.

When bleeding lasts for weeks, structure is imposed. She performs ghusl at the end of the fifteenth day if menstruation was valid at the beginning. After that, she prays and fasts, managing the discharge as istiḥāḍah by cleaning herself and performing wuḍū’ for each prayer time.

Length alone does not make it ḥayḍ. Legal limits define it.`

        [
          "Clear discharge mixed with faint blood daily.",
          `This is judged by timing and limits, not by dilution.

If this mixture appears after fifteen full days of valid ṭuhr, and it forms a connected episode within fifteen days, it can be treated as ḥayḍ, even if the blood is faint and mixed with clear fluid.

If it appears before fifteen days of ṭuhr have passed, it cannot be a new ḥayḍ. It is istiḥāḍah.

If it continues beyond fifteen days, then only the first fifteen may be counted as ḥayḍ if menstruation was valid at the start. Anything beyond that is istiḥāḍah.

If the discharge is light, scattered, and does not form a coherent menstrual episode, it is treated as istiḥāḍah from the outset.

The mixture of clear discharge with faint blood does not alter the structure. The ruling follows timing, continuity, and the maximum limit.`

          "Habit 6 days, bleeding continues 14.",
          `If her established habit is six days but the bleeding continues until day fourteen, the ruling follows the legal limit, not the old pattern.

As long as the bleeding remains continuous and the total does not exceed fifteen days, all fourteen days are treated as ḥayḍ.

Habit becomes decisive when the maximum is crossed or when there is confusion. It does not automatically cut the cycle short while bleeding continues within the permissible ceiling.

So in this case, the entire fourteen days are ḥayḍ. She does not pray or fast during those days. When confirmed ṭuhr appears, she performs ghusl and resumes worship.`

          "Habit unclear but consistent pattern last 3 months.",
          `If her old habit is unclear, but for the last three months she has seen the same consistent pattern, that new pattern is treated as her ʿādah.

In fiqh, habit is established by stability. When a pattern repeats in a consistent way over consecutive cycles, it becomes the reference point moving forward. The Sharīʿah looks at what is currently stable, not what was distant or forgotten.

So if for three months she has bled, for example, eight days each time in a similar structure, that eight-day pattern now functions as her habit. If irregularity occurs afterward, she refers back to this established pattern.

However, all of this operates within the legal limits. No ḥayḍ can exceed fifteen days. No new cycle can begin without fifteen days of valid ṭuhr in between.

Consistency creates certainty. Once a pattern stabilizes, it becomes the anchor for future rulings unless it clearly changes again.
