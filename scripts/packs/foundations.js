      cases: [

        [
          "Definition of Ḥayḍ",
          `Ḥayḍ in the Maliki school refers to natural menstrual blood that exits from a healthy woman at intervals. When legally classified as ḥayḍ, it suspends prayer, fasting, marital intimacy, and certain acts of worship. It is determined by time limits, habit, and continuity.`
        ],

        [
          "Definition of Ṭuhr",
          `Ṭuhr is the state of legal purity between menstrual cycles. It begins when bleeding ceases and is confirmed through dryness or the well-known white discharge. Upon ṭuhr, ghusl becomes obligatory before resuming prayer.`
        ],

        [
          "Definition of Istiḥāḍah",
          `Istiḥāḍah is irregular bleeding that does not fall within menstrual or nifās parameters. It does not suspend worship. The woman continues prayer and fasting while observing purification discipline.`
        ],

        [
          "Definition of Nifās",
          `Nifās is blood that exits following childbirth. It suspends worship like ḥayḍ until purity is confirmed or the maximum duration is reached.`
        ],

        [
          "Legal Weight of Habit (ʿĀdah)",
          `Habit holds strong authority in the Maliki school. When bleeding exceeds limits, the established recurring pattern determines which portion is ḥayḍ and which portion becomes istiḥāḍah.`
        ]
      ]
    },

    {
      heading: "Minimums and Maximums (6–10)",

      cases: [

        [
          "Minimum duration of ḥayḍ",
          `For bleeding to qualify as ḥayḍ, it must meet the legal minimum duration recognized by the school. Blood that appears too briefly may not fulfill the threshold and can be classified as istiḥāḍah.`
        ],

        [
          "Maximum duration of ḥayḍ",
          `Ḥayḍ has a defined maximum limit. Any blood beyond that limit automatically converts to istiḥāḍah regardless of appearance.`
        ],

        [
          "Minimum interval of ṭuhr",
          `There must be a valid interval of purity between menstrual cycles. Without sufficient ṭuhr, bleeding may remain part of a prior episode.`
        ],

        [
          "Maximum duration of nifās",
          `Nifās has a defined maximum limit in the Maliki school. Once that maximum is reached, bleeding becomes istiḥāḍah even if it continues.`
        ],

        [
          "When limits override appearance",
          `Time limits govern classification. Even if blood resembles menstrual flow, exceeding the maximum transforms it legally into istiḥāḍah.`
        ]

      heading: "Color and Continuity Rules (11–15)",

      cases: [

        [
          "Does color determine classification?",
          `Color alone does not determine ḥayḍ. Red, brown, yellow, or dark blood may all qualify if within legal limits and continuity.`
        ],

        [
          "Connected vs separate discharge",
          `If brown or yellow discharge connects directly to menstrual blood without confirmed purity in between, it forms part of ḥayḍ.`
        ],

        [
          "Dryness as proof of purity",
          `Clear dryness or recognized white discharge establishes ṭuhr. Temporary moisture without blood does not necessarily end ḥayḍ.`
        ],

        [
          "Short interruptions in bleeding",
          `Brief pauses within menstrual limits do not automatically establish ṭuhr. Continuity is assessed carefully.`
        ],

        [
          "Doubt about purity",
          `Certainty is not removed by doubt. If purity was confirmed clearly, later suspicion does not revert the ruling.`

      heading: "Ghusl and Worship Suspension (16–20)",

      cases: [

        [
          "When does ghusl become obligatory?",
          `Ghusl becomes obligatory once valid ḥayḍ or nifās ends and purity is confirmed. Prayer cannot resume without ghusl.`
        ],

        [
          "Praying before ghusl mistakenly",
          `If prayer is performed before ghusl while still in ḥayḍ or nifās, it is invalid and must be repeated after purification.`
        ],

        [
          "Fasting during ḥayḍ",
          `Fasting during valid ḥayḍ or nifās is invalid and must be made up later.`
        ],

        [
          "Qur’an recitation during ḥayḍ",
          `The Maliki school restricts certain forms of Qur’an recitation during ḥayḍ. Istiḥāḍah does not carry this restriction.`
        ],

        [
          "Marital intimacy during ḥayḍ",
          `Marital relations are prohibited during ḥayḍ and nifās until purity and ghusl are completed.`

    {
      heading: "Applied Decision Cases (21–30)",

      cases: [

        [
          "Bleeding exceeds habit but not maximum.",
          `If bleeding exceeds established habit yet remains within maximum limit, classification depends on habit authority. Habit portion remains ḥayḍ.`
        ],

        [
          "Bleeding stops exactly at maximum day.",
          `If cessation occurs within maximum limit, it is valid ḥayḍ. Ghusl becomes obligatory immediately upon purity.`
        ],

        [
          "Spotting before menstrual window.",
          `If discharge appears outside menstrual parameters without continuity, it is istiḥāḍah.`
        ],

        [
          "Postpartum bleeding stops early.",
          `If purity confirmed before maximum nifās duration, worship resumes immediately.`
        ],

        [
          "Blood returns within nifās window.",
          `If within maximum duration and no legal separation occurred, it remains nifās.`
        ],

        [
          "Uncertain whether bleeding is ḥayḍ or istiḥāḍah.",
          `Return to habit, limits, and continuity. Legal structure resolves ambiguity.`
        ],

        [
          "Very irregular cycle with no stable habit.",
          `In absence of habit, classification relies on time limits and repeated patterns.`
        ],

        [
          "Bleeding identical but exceeds maximum.",
          `Similarity does not override time boundaries. Excess is istiḥāḍah.`
        ],

        [
          "Clear white discharge appears.",
          `The appearance of recognized white discharge confirms ṭuhr and obligates ghusl.`
        ],

        [
          "Fear and confusion about rulings.",
