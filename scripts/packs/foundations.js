          "Definition of Ḥayḍ",
          `Ḥayḍ in the language refers to flowing. In the terminology of the jurists, it is the natural blood that Allāh causes to flow from the womb of a woman at specific times, without illness, childbirth, or injury.

It is not blood from a wound. It is not bleeding due to disease. It is not post-natal bleeding. It is a recurring, natural discharge that occurs after a girl reaches puberty and before menopause, according to a pattern known to her body.

The scholars define it carefully to distinguish it from istiḥāḍah. Istiḥāḍah is irregular bleeding caused by a vein and is considered medical bleeding. Ḥayḍ is cyclical and tied to the womb’s natural function.

Legally, Ḥayḍ is the state that prevents a woman from prayer, fasting, and certain other acts of worship until she sees purity and performs ghusl. It is a divinely decreed condition, not a deficiency, not impurity in the moral sense, and not a punishment. It is part of the fitrah Allāh created in women.

In essence, Ḥayḍ is natural, recurring uterine blood that flows at known times, within recognized limits, and carries specific legal rulings in Sharīʿah.'
`
        ],

        [
          "Definition of Ṭuhr",
          `Ṭuhr in the language means cleanliness and purification.

In the terminology of fiqh, ṭuhr in the context of menstruation refers to the state in which menstrual blood has completely stopped and a woman becomes legally pure from ḥayḍ.

This purity is established by one of two clear signs known to women:

Either complete dryness, such that when she checks with cotton or tissue it comes out clean with no trace of blood, yellow, or brown discharge.

Or the appearance of the white discharge known among women as al-qaṣṣah al-bayḍā’.

Once one of these signs appears, she is considered ṭāhir. At that moment, the rulings of menstruation end. She performs ghusl and resumes prayer, fasting, and other acts of worship.

Ṭuhr is therefore not based on assumption, lightening of color, or wishful thinking. It is based on the clear cessation of ḥayḍ as recognized by its established signs.
`
        ],

        [
          "Definition of Istiḥāḍah",
          `Istiḥāḍah in the language comes from the root meaning “to flow.”

In the terminology of fiqh, istiḥāḍah is abnormal, non-menstrual bleeding that exits from the womb outside the valid limits of ḥayḍ and nifās.

It is blood that does not follow the natural menstrual cycle. The jurists explain that it comes from a vein, not from the natural menstrual process. For this reason, it is treated as a medical condition, not as menstruation.

Legally, a woman in istiḥāḍah is considered ṭāhir in ruling. She prays, fasts, recites Qur’an, and her husband may be intimate with her. However, because the bleeding continues, she manages it practically. When the time of prayer enters, she washes the area, applies protection, performs wuḍū’, and prays. That wuḍū’ remains valid for that prayer time even if the bleeding continues.

The distinction between ḥayḍ and istiḥāḍah is crucial. Ḥayḍ prevents prayer and fasting. Istiḥāḍah does not. The difference is determined by timing, duration, and the established limits recognized in Sharīʿah.
`
        ],

        [
          "Definition of Nifās",
          `Nifās is the bleeding that comes after a woman gives birth.

It is not ordinary menstruation. It is blood connected specifically to delivery. The moment childbirth occurs, and blood follows as a result of it, that blood is called nifās.

In Sharīʿah, nifās places a woman in a temporary state similar to ḥayḍ. She does not pray and she does not fast during that time. She is not sinful for leaving these acts. In fact, she is obeying Allāh by accepting His concession. When the bleeding stops, she performs ghusl and returns to prayer and fasting. If she missed days of Ramaḍān, she makes those up later, but she does not make up the prayers.

There is no fixed minimum length for nifās. It could be a few days. It ends whenever the bleeding fully stops and she sees purity. However, the majority of scholars state that its maximum limit is forty days. If bleeding continues beyond forty, what remains is treated as istiḥāḍah, not nifās, unless it coincides with her normal menstrual pattern.

So in simple terms, nifās is post-childbirth bleeding that carries temporary rulings of suspension from prayer and fasting until purity is seen.
`
        ],

        [
          "Legal Weight of Habit (ʿĀdah)",
          `In the Mālikī school, ʿādah is not a secondary consideration. It carries real legal weight in matters of ḥayḍ and istiḥāḍah.

If a woman has a known, consistent cycle in length and timing, that habit becomes her primary reference when irregularities occur. The body has memory. The Sharīʿah acknowledges that.

If bleeding becomes confusing or prolonged, the Mālikīs first look to her previous regular pattern. If she used to menstruate, for example, six days every month, then upon irregular bleeding she treats six days as ḥayḍ and what exceeds that as istiḥāḍah, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. Her established habit overrides doubt.

However, the Mālikī school also recognizes maximum limits. The maximum duration of ḥayḍ according to the Mālikīs is fifteen days. So habit operates within that ceiling. If bleeding exceeds fifteen days, anything beyond fifteen cannot legally remain ḥayḍ, even if her body continues to discharge.

Another important Mālikī principle is that habit can be established even after one occurrence if it becomes consistent in the next cycle. But once a habit stabilizes, it is not abandoned easily. Doubt does not cancel certainty. A stable ʿādah is certainty.

If a woman has no stable habit, then the Mālikīs look to distinguishing features of blood. If she cannot distinguish, then they revert to the common average of women.

So in the Mālikī approach, ʿādah is a controlling factor. It is a legal anchor in times of confusion. The Sharīʿah does not leave a woman suspended in uncertainty every month. It gives her a structured method grounded in her own biological pattern.`

        [
          "Minimum duration of ḥayḍ",
          `According to the Mālikī school, there is no fixed minimum duration for ḥayḍ.

If blood appears that has the characteristics of menstrual blood and it occurs at a time when menstruation is possible, even if it is only for a short period, it is considered ḥayḍ. It could be a day. It could be less than a full day. The Mālikīs do not set a strict numerical minimum such as one day or three days.

What matters in their reasoning is the reality of the blood itself and the context in which it appears. If it is the type of blood known to be menstrual, and it occurs within the age and time frame in which menstruation is valid, it is treated as ḥayḍ.

However, they do set a maximum limit, which is fifteen days. Anything beyond fifteen days cannot remain ḥayḍ in their school.
`

        [
          "Maximum duration of ḥayḍ",
          `According to the Mālikī madhhab, the maximum duration of ḥayḍ is fifteen days.

If bleeding continues beyond fifteen days, what exceeds fifteen cannot legally remain ḥayḍ. At that point, the excess is treated as istiḥāḍah, even if the blood continues to appear similar in color.

So if a woman bleeds for twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days, all of that may be considered ḥayḍ. But the moment it crosses fifteen complete days, the ruling changes. She must treat day sixteen onward as istiḥāḍah, perform ghusl after completing fifteen days, and resume prayer.

This fifteen-day ceiling is firm in the Mālikī school. There is no allowance beyond it.`
        ],

        [
          "Minimum interval of ṭuhr",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, the minimum interval of ṭuhr between two valid menstruations is fifteen complete days. This is not an estimate. It is a legal boundary.

What does this mean?

It means that once a woman becomes pure from her ḥayḍ, and she performs ghusl, a new ḥayḍ cannot legally begin unless fifteen full days of purity have passed. If blood appears before the completion of fifteen days, that blood is not treated as a new menstruation. It cannot be called ḥayḍ in the Mālikī school.

Why? Because the Sharīʿah does not allow menstruation to overlap without a clear separation. There must be a valid period of ṭuhr between two cycles. Without that separation, what appears is treated either as continuation of previous bleeding or as istiḥāḍah, depending on the case.

Understand this well. The fifteen days refer to the interval between two menstruations. It does not refer to discharge within one continuous cycle. Many women confuse this point.

So if a woman becomes pure, then ten days later she sees blood again, the Mālikī ruling is clear. This cannot be a new ḥayḍ. It does not meet the minimum interval of ṭuhr.

These limits exist to remove confusion and to protect certainty.
.`
        ],

        [
          "Maximum duration of nifās",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, the maximum duration of nifās is **sixty days**.

If post-childbirth bleeding continues, it may legally be treated as nifās up to sixty days. Once sixty days are completed, anything beyond that cannot remain nifās. It is then treated as istiḥāḍah.

There is no fixed minimum for nifās. It could end in a few days. The moment the bleeding stops and purity is seen, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting, even if that is well before forty or sixty days.

The sixty-day ceiling is a legal safeguard for cases of prolonged bleeding. It is not the norm. Most women complete nifās much earlier. But the Mālikī school gives that extended upper limit due to observed realities among women.

After sixty days, if bleeding continues, she returns to prayer and manages it as istiḥāḍah, unless it coincides with her normal ḥayḍ pattern.`
        ],

        [
          "When limits override appearance",
          `In the Mālikī school, appearance of blood alone is not always decisive. Sharʿī limits sometimes override what the eye sees.

If a woman continues to see blood, but the bleeding reaches the maximum limit of ḥayḍ, which in the Mālikī madhhab is fifteen days, then once the fifteenth day ends, the law intervenes. Even if blood is still visible, it can no longer be treated as ḥayḍ. It is legally reclassified as istiḥāḍah. The legal ceiling overrides the sensory appearance.

The same principle applies to nifās. If postnatal bleeding continues beyond sixty days, it cannot remain nifās. After sixty days, what is seen is treated as istiḥāḍah, regardless of color or flow.

Likewise, if bleeding appears before fifteen days of valid ṭuhr have passed between two cycles, it cannot be considered a new ḥayḍ, even if it looks identical to menstrual blood. The minimum interval overrides the appearance.

Why does the Sharīʿah do this? Because law requires structure. If rulings were based purely on color and perception without limits, worship would become unstable. A woman could remain suspended indefinitely, uncertain whether she is obligated to pray.

So the Mālikī method balances three things: habit, distinguishing features, and fixed limits. When habit and appearance operate within the limits, they are followed. When they cross the legal boundary, the limit governs.

This prevents chaos. It also prevents hardship.

In short, when blood exceeds the maximum of ḥayḍ or nifās, or when purity has not reached its minimum interval, the Sharʿī limit overrides what the eye sees. Law stabilizes what nature fluctuates.`

      cases: [

        [
          "Does colour determine classification?",
          `Colour alone does not determine classification.

In the Mālikī school, blood is not judged merely by whether it is red, dark, brown, yellow, or light. Classification depends first on timing, continuity, habit, and the established legal limits.

If discharge appears during the valid days of ḥayḍ and before purity has been established, then even brown or yellow discharge is treated as ḥayḍ. The companion Umm ʿAṭiyyah said that they did not consider yellow and brown discharge after purity to be anything. The key phrase is after purity. Before purity, it carries weight.

However, once the maximum limit of ḥayḍ is reached, which in the Mālikī madhhab is fifteen days, colour no longer matters. Even if the blood looks exactly like menstrual blood, it cannot remain ḥayḍ. It becomes istiḥāḍah by force of law.

Likewise, if bleeding appears before fifteen days of valid ṭuhr between cycles, it cannot be classified as a new ḥayḍ, even if its color resembles menstrual blood.

Colour can assist in distinguishing when a woman has no clear habit and is within valid limits. But it does not override established legal boundaries. Timing and structure come first. Appearance supports. It does not control.It informs the discussion, but it does not independently determine the ruling.
.`
        ],

        [
          "Connected vs separate discharge",
          `Connected discharge means that the bleeding and colored discharge occur in one continuous flow without a true sign of purity appearing in between. Even if the color changes from red to dark to brown to yellow, as long as there is no complete dryness and no white discharge indicating ṭuhr, it is treated as one ongoing ḥayḍ. Variation in shade does not break continuity. The cycle remains legally unified.

Separate discharge is different. It means a valid ṭuhr occurred in between. That means she saw complete dryness or the white discharge. Once that sign appears, the previous ḥayḍ has ended. If blood or brown discharge appears after that confirmed purity, we treat it as a new occurrence and evaluate it independently. It may become a new ḥayḍ if the minimum interval of ṭuhr has passed. If not, it may be istiḥāḍah.

The critical factor is not color change. It is whether a real sign of purity appeared in between. Lightening does not equal separation. Reduction does not equal separation. Only established ṭuhr separates.

So continuity keeps the rulings connected. Confirmed purity resets the ruling entirely.
.`
        ],

        [
          "Dryness as proof of purity",
          `In the Mālikī school, dryness is a valid and decisive proof of ṭuhr.

If a woman checks and finds complete dryness, meaning nothing comes out on the cotton or tissue. No red, no brown, no yellow. Then she is considered ṭāhir at that moment. She performs ghusl and resumes prayer.

Dryness is not defined by light flow or faint color. It means the passage is clean. The scholars speak of inserting cotton and it coming out pure. That is the operational test.

However, two points must be understood carefully.

First, dryness must be real, not assumed. If she checks once during active bleeding and sees temporary pause for a short time, but then blood resumes in a pattern clearly connected to her ḥayḍ days, the Mālikīs consider whether that pause is stable or merely intermittent fluctuation. Not every short pause counts as full ṭuhr. Stability matters.

Second, if dryness is seen near the end of her usual habit, and then later some brown discharge returns before the maximum limit of fifteen days, the ruling depends on whether the dryness was established and stable. If it was a true ṭuhr, then what follows is treated separately. If it was only a brief interruption within ongoing ḥayḍ, then it remains connected.

The principle is this. True, confirmed dryness establishes ṭuhr. Once ṭuhr is established, the previous ḥayḍ has legally ended. But uncertainty or fleeting pause does not overturn continuity.
.`
        ],

        [
          "Short interruptions in bleeding",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, short interruptions in bleeding are not automatically treated as ṭuhr.

If a woman is within her normal days of ḥayḍ and the bleeding pauses briefly, then resumes, this pause is usually treated as part of the same ḥayḍ, especially if it occurs within the overall maximum of fifteen days. The Mālikīs are cautious about declaring purity based on very brief or unstable dryness.

The key issue is whether the dryness is established and reliable. If she checks and finds dryness, but the pattern shows fluctuation during active ḥayḍ days, many Mālikī jurists consider that interruption connected to the ongoing menstruation. It does not force her into ghusl every time there is a temporary stop.

However, if she sees clear dryness that resembles the end of her cycle, and it remains stable in a way consistent with how her menstruation normally ends, then that dryness counts as ṭuhr. If bleeding returns later, it is assessed separately.

Women are not required to perform ghusl repeatedly due to minor, unstable pauses. Continuity is preserved unless a clear and settled sign of purity appears.
.`
        ],

        [
          "Doubt about purity",
          `If a woman is certain she is still in ḥayḍ and then becomes unsure whether she has reached ṭuhr, she remains upon the ruling of ḥayḍ until she sees a clear sign of purity. Suspicion, lightness of color, or hope does not establish ṭuhr.

Likewise, if she is certain she has become ṭāhir and later doubts whether that dryness was real, she remains upon ṭuhr. She does not return to ḥayḍ merely because of doubt.

The governing principle is: certainty is not removed by doubt.

Purity is established only by one of its recognized signs. Until that sign appears clearly, she does not perform ghusl. Once it appears clearly, she does not undo it because of later hesitation.

The Mālikī method protects stability. It prevents a woman from living in constant anxiety, going back and forth between rulings based on uncertainty.

So when doubt arises, return to what was certain before it. Remain upon it until something clear changes it.

      cases: [

        [
          "When does ghusl become obligatory?",
          `Ghusl becomes obligatory the moment a state that requires major purification ends.

In the context of ḥayḍ and nifās, ghusl becomes obligatory when ṭuhr is established. That means the bleeding has completely stopped and one of the recognized signs of purity appears, either confirmed dryness or the white discharge known to women. At that moment, she is no longer legally menstruating, and ghusl becomes binding before she may pray or fast.

If the time of prayer has entered and she has become ṭāhir, she must perform ghusl in order to pray. She does not delay it unnecessarily once purity is confirmed.

Ghusl is also obligatory after sexual intercourse, even if there was no ejaculation, and after ejaculation whether awake or asleep. It is likewise obligatory when a woman gives birth and her nifās ends.

The principle is simple. Whenever the legal cause of major ritual impurity ends or occurs in the case of intercourse, ghusl becomes required before returning to acts that demand purity.`
        ],

        [
          "Praying before ghusl mistakenly",
          `If a woman prayed thinking she was pure, and later discovered that she had not actually reached ṭuhr, then those prayers are not valid. She must repeat them once purity is truly established and ghusl is performed. This is not a sin if it was a genuine mistake. Acts of worship require ṭahārah, and when a condition is missing, the act must be redone, but the person is not sinful for ignorance or error.

If she had in fact reached purity but delayed ghusl out of forgetfulness or confusion and then prayed without it, the prayer is still invalid and must be repeated. Major ritual impurity cannot be lifted without ghusl.

However, if she made ijtihād, checked properly, saw dryness, performed ghusl, prayed, and later doubted whether that dryness was real, she does not repeat the prayer merely because of doubt. Certainty at the time is sufficient.

So the ruling depends on what actually occurred. If true purity had not yet happened, the prayers must be made up. If it had happened and she acted reasonably, then doubt afterward does not invalidate what she already performed.

Here, ijtihād means that she exerted reasonable effort to determine her state. In matters of ḥayḍ and ṭuhr, a woman is required to check and assess based on the recognized signs. If she examines properly, looks for dryness or the white discharge, considers her usual pattern, and then makes a sincere judgment that she has become pure, that effort is her ijtihād.

If later she discovers she was mistaken, there is no sin upon her because she acted upon her best effort. The Sharīʿah does not burden a person beyond reasonable capacity. Accountability is tied to negligence, not honest error.`
        ],

        [
          "Fasting during ḥayḍ",
          `Fasting during ḥayḍ is not valid.

If a woman is menstruating, she is not permitted to fast. This is a ruling. The Prophet ﷺ clarified that women do not pray and do not fast during menstruation, and this was accepted by consensus of the scholars.

If she fasts while knowingly in ḥayḍ, the fast is invalid and she must make up that day. It does not count, even if she completes the entire day abstaining from food and drink. The condition of purity is required for the validity of fasting.

If she becomes pure before Fajr and performs ghusl after Fajr, her fast for that day is valid as long as purity occurred before dawn. Ghusl does not have to happen before Fajr for the fast to count. What matters is that the bleeding stopped before Fajr.

If she becomes pure after Fajr, even moments after, she cannot fast that day. She refrains out of respect for Ramaḍān, but she must still make it up later.

There is no sin in not fasting during ḥayḍ. In fact, fasting in that state would be disobedience, because she would be opposing the legal ruling. Making up the missed days later completes her obligation.`
        ],

        [
          "Qur’an recitation during ḥayḍ",
          `This is an issue in which the scholars differed. The majority of classical jurists held that a menstruating woman should not recite the Qur’an verbally until she becomes pure. They based this on reports that, although debated in authenticity, were acted upon by many early scholars. According to this view, she may make dhikr, duʿā’, and read tafsīr, but she does not recite Qur’an as tilāwah until ṭuhr.

However, the Mālikī school and a number of later scholars permitted a woman in ḥayḍ to recite the Qur’an. Their reasoning was strong and practical. They argued that menstruation is not like janābah. Janābah is within one’s control and can be lifted immediately by ghusl. Ḥayḍ is not. It may last many days. Preventing her from recitation for a week or more every month would lead to hardship, especially for students and those who are memorizing.

In the Mālikī position, she may recite from memory during ḥayḍ. Touching the muṣḥaf, however, remains restricted without purification according to the dominant opinion, unless she uses a barrier or reads from a device.

So the matter depends on which school you follow. If you follow the Mālikī madhhab, recitation during ḥayḍ is permitted. If you follow the view of the majority, you would refrain from verbal recitation until purity.

What is important is consistency. Do not move between opinions for convenience alone. Follow a structured approach grounded in knowledge.`
        ],

        [
          "Marital intimacy during ḥayḍ",
          `Allāh addressed this matter clearly in the Qur’an:

“They ask you about menstruation. Say: it is harm, so keep away from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they become pure.” [Qur’an 2:222]

The prohibition here refers specifically to vaginal intercourse. That is categorically ḥarām during ḥayḍ by consensus of the scholars. It is not a minor dislike. It is a clear prohibition.

When the bleeding stops and ṭuhr is established, she must perform ghusl before intercourse becomes permissible. In the Mālikī madhhab, the completion of ghusl is required before intimacy resumes.

As for other forms of physical closeness, the scholars differed. The majority permitted intimacy short of intercourse, provided the area between the navel and knee is avoided. The Mālikī school is generally more cautious but does not prohibit affectionate contact altogether. The key is avoiding what leads directly to the forbidden act and maintaining modest boundaries.

If intercourse occurs during ḥayḍ knowingly, both spouses have committed a sin and must repent sincerely. Some scholars also recommended giving charity as expiation based on certain narrations, though repentance is the primary obligation.

The wisdom behind the prohibition is not humiliation or impurity in a moral sense. The verse itself describes it as harm, meaning physical and possibly medical harm. The Sharīʿah protects both spouses.

So the ruling is clear. Intercourse during ḥayḍ is prohibited. Affection and kindness are not prohibited, but they must remain within lawful limits until purity is complete and ghusl is performed.

          "Bleeding exceeds habit but not maximum.",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, when bleeding exceeds a woman’s established habit but does not exceed the maximum limit of fifteen days, it is still treated as ḥayḍ.

If a woman’s regular ʿādah is, for example, seven days, and in a particular month she continues bleeding for nine, ten, or even thirteen days, all of that is considered ḥayḍ so long as it remains within fifteen days and there has been no confirmed ṭuhr in between.

In the Mālikī approach, the maximum limit governs. Habit is strong, but it does not automatically cut off menstruation when bleeding continues naturally and continuously within the legal ceiling.

Only when the bleeding crosses fifteen days does the ruling change. At that point, the excess cannot remain ḥayḍ. It is reclassified as istiḥāḍah, and her previous stable habit becomes relevant in determining which days count as ḥayḍ.

So if bleeding exceeds her usual seven days but stops on day twelve, all twelve days are ḥayḍ. She does not pray or fast during them. Once she sees ṭuhr, she performs ghusl and resumes worship.

The principle here is that habit guides, but the maximum limit controls. As long as the bleeding stays under fifteen days and remains connected, it remains legally ḥayḍ.`

          `If the bleeding continues up to the fifteenth day and then stops exactly at the end of that day, it is all considered ḥayḍ. There is no problem in that. The law allows menstruation to extend to its full maximum.

Once she sees ṭuhr at the completion of the fifteenth day, she performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting. Nothing from those fifteen days is treated as istiḥāḍah because the bleeding did not exceed the legal ceiling.

The critical line is crossing the maximum. If blood appears on day sixteen, then day sixteen cannot be counted as ḥayḍ. But if it ends precisely at fifteen, then the entire period remains valid ḥayḍ.

The limit functions as a boundary, not a suspicion. Reaching it is valid. Exceeding it changes the ruling.`

        [
          "Spotting before menstrual window.",
          `According to the Mālikī madhhab, spotting before the expected menstrual window is not automatically classified as ḥayḍ.

The first question is whether it occurs within a time in which menstruation is legally possible and whether the minimum interval of ṭuhr has passed. If fifteen days of valid purity have not passed since the last ḥayḍ, then that spotting cannot be treated as a new menstruation. It is istiḥāḍah by rule, even if it resembles menstrual blood.

If fifteen days of ṭuhr have passed, then we look further. If the spotting is connected to the flow of what becomes full menstruation, and it continues within the valid limits, then it is counted as ḥayḍ from the moment it began. Even light brown or slight discharge counts if it is the beginning of the cycle and remains connected.

But if the spotting appears briefly and stops, without developing into a proper menstrual flow, then it is not treated as ḥayḍ. It is considered irregular discharge.

So the Mālikī method does not judge by expectation of a “window.” It judges by legal possibility, continuity, and limits. If the conditions of ḥayḍ are met, it is ḥayḍ even if earlier than usual. If the conditions are not met, it remains istiḥāḍah.`

If postpartum bleeding stops early, even after only a few days, and she sees confirmed ṭuhr through complete dryness or the white discharge, then her nifās has ended. She performs ghusl immediately and resumes prayer and fasting. She does not wait for forty days or sixty days simply because that is common. The law follows reality, not averages.

If bleeding later returns within the maximum of sixty days, the ruling depends on the situation. If the purity in between was real and established, then what returns is evaluated independently. It may be treated as resumed nifās if still within sixty days, or possibly as ḥayḍ if it matches her normal cycle and sufficient ṭuhr has passed. Each case is assessed carefully.

But if the bleeding stops, purity is clear, and no further discharge appears, then her nifās has truly ended, even if it lasted only a short time.

The principle is simple. Nifās ends when purity appears. The maximum limit protects against prolonged bleeding, but there is no required minimum that forces her to remain in suspension.`

          `The maximum duration of nifās is sixty days.

If postpartum bleeding stops, she sees clear ṭuhr, performs ghusl, and resumes prayer, then later blood returns within that sixty-day window, we examine the gap in between.

If the purity was brief and the bleeding returns in a way that appears connected to the original postpartum flow, the Mālikīs generally treat it as a continuation of nifās. The days of purity in between are still considered days of nifās in ruling, meaning she was not required to pray during them if the return was clearly connected and within the sixty-day ceiling.

However, if the period of purity was established and stable, and especially if a significant time passed, then what returns may be evaluated separately. If it resembles normal menstruation and sufficient ṭuhr has passed according to her cycle, it may be classified as ḥayḍ. If it does not meet those conditions, it may be istiḥāḍah.

The decisive boundary is sixty days. As long as the total does not exceed sixty, resumed bleeding can still fall under nifās. Once sixty days are completed, anything beyond that cannot legally remain nifās and is treated as istiḥāḍah unless it coincides with a valid ḥayḍ pattern.

So the ruling depends on continuity, stability of prior purity, and the total duration within the legal limit.`

          "Uncertain whether bleeding is ḥayḍ or istiḥāḍah.",
          `When uncertainty arises between ḥayḍ and istiḥāḍah in the Mālikī madhhab, the law does not leave a woman suspended in confusion. There is an order of evaluation.

First, her established ʿādah is consulted. If she has a stable, known pattern in length and timing, that pattern governs. What matches her known cycle is treated as ḥayḍ. What exceeds it beyond the legal limits is treated as istiḥāḍah. Habit carries strong weight.

If she does not have a stable habit, then the next consideration is the legal boundaries. Bleeding cannot be ḥayḍ if it exceeds fifteen days. It cannot be a new ḥayḍ if fifteen days of valid ṭuhr have not passed since the last one. These limits override confusion.

If she has neither a stable habit nor clarity from limits, then distinguishing features of the blood may be considered. Menstrual blood is often darker, thicker, and has a distinct odor, though these signs are supportive and not absolute.

If distinction is still unclear, she returns to the common average of women and adopts a structured pattern rather than remaining in doubt.

The guiding principle is this. Certainty is not removed by doubt. Established purity remains until proven otherwise. Established ḥayḍ remains until purity is clearly seen. When in doubt, she follows the strongest anchor available, beginning with habit, then limits, then distinguishing signs.

The Sharīʿah aims for stability, not monthly anxiety.`

          "Very irregular cycle with no stable habit.",
          `When a woman has no stable ʿādah at all, the Mālikī school does not leave her without a method. The Sharīʿah moves in stages.

First, we look to the legal limits. No bleeding can be considered ḥayḍ beyond fifteen days. No new ḥayḍ can begin unless fifteen days of valid ṭuhr have passed since the end of the previous one. These two boundaries frame everything.

If her cycle is completely irregular and she cannot rely on habit, then we examine the nature of the bleeding. Menstrual blood often has distinguishing characteristics. It is usually darker, thicker, and has a noticeable odor compared to istiḥāḍah, which tends to be lighter and more like ordinary blood. If she can reasonably distinguish based on these traits, she treats what resembles ḥayḍ as ḥayḍ within the fifteen-day maximum.

If she cannot distinguish by appearance, then she adopts a structured pattern based on the common duration of women. Many Mālikī jurists refer her to a reasonable average rather than allowing indefinite fluctuation. This creates stability in her worship.

The goal is not to chase every variation in discharge. The goal is to establish a consistent method anchored in limits and practical judgment. Once she adopts a structured approach, she remains upon it unless a clearer pattern emerges.

So even without a stable habit, she is not without guidance. The law provides order where biology fluctuates`

          "Bleeding identical but exceeds maximum.",
          `In the Mālikī madhhab, once the bleeding exceeds the maximum of fifteen days, it cannot remain ḥayḍ. This is true even if the blood looks exactly like menstrual blood in color, thickness, or smell.

Here, the legal limit overrides appearance.

If a woman bleeds continuously for sixteen days, the first fifteen days are treated as ḥayḍ. Day sixteen and anything beyond it is classified as istiḥāḍah by force of law, regardless of how identical it looks to her normal menses.

This is because Sharʿī rulings require boundaries. Without a maximum, a woman could remain indefinitely suspended from prayer. The limit prevents that.

Once day fifteen ends, she must perform ghusl and resume prayer and fasting. The continuing bleeding is managed as istiḥāḍah. She cleans herself, protects the area, performs wuḍū’ for each prayer time, and prays even if blood continues to flow.

So similarity in appearance does not preserve the ruling once the legal ceiling has been crossed. Structure governs where nature fluctuates.`

          "Clear white discharge appears.",
          `When the clear white discharge appears, this is one of the decisive signs of ṭuhr.

In the Mālikī madhhab, the appearance of the white discharge known among women as al-qaṣṣah al-bayḍā’ marks the end of ḥayḍ or nifās. The moment it appears clearly, she is considered ṭāhir. She performs ghusl and resumes prayer and fasting.

She does not wait for further confirmation once that sign is established. The Companions’ women used to recognize this discharge as the end of menstruation. It is a reliable biological marker.

If light brown or yellow discharge appears after this confirmed purity, it is not treated as ḥayḍ, as long as the purity was real and established. It is considered ordinary discharge unless it develops into a new cycle after a valid interval of ṭuhr.

The key is certainty. Once the white discharge appears clearly, the previous state of ḥayḍ has ended. Ghusl becomes obligatory, and the rulings of menstruation cease.`

          "Fear and confusion about rulings.",
          `The rulings of ḥayḍ were revealed to bring order and mercy, not anxiety and fear. If studying them is increasing confusion and panic, then something in the approach needs adjustment.

The Sharīʿah is built upon clarity and stability. Allāh does not command you to live in monthly suspense, questioning every drop and every shade. The Prophet ﷺ did not teach women to obsess. He gave them signs, limits, and structure so that worship could continue with confidence.

When fear dominates, return to three anchors.

First, follow one structured approach consistently. Do not jump between madhāhib every time a detail shifts. Consistency reduces confusion.

Second, rely on certainty. Do not let doubt push you back and forth. If you are in ḥayḍ with certainty, remain on it until clear purity appears. If you are ṭāhir with certainty, remain on it until clear bleeding establishes otherwise. Certainty is not removed by doubt.

Third, remember that Allāh does not punish honest mistakes. If you exert reasonable effort and act sincerely, even if you later discover you were mistaken, there is no sin upon you. Worship is not invalidated by sincere effort coupled with ignorance beyond your control.

Excessive fear in these matters can sometimes resemble waswasah. The cure for that is structure, not more analysis. Choose a method. Apply it calmly. Do not revisit it every hour. You are required to worship with reasonable diligence..`
